Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Challenge

 In this exciting task, I use my Python skills and expertise in unsupervised learning . The goal is to predict whether cryptocurrencies experience fluctuations in their prices over 24 hours or exhibit trends over a 7-day period. This challenge not only hones my programming proficiency but also delves into the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency markets. I employ machine learning techniques to make predictions that could have a real impact in the world of digital currencies.
